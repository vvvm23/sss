This is an <i>italics</i> element. This is a <a href="https://github.com/vvvm23">link</a>. <h2>Introduction </h2>Cappuccino is the main antagonist of The Killer Bean and Killer Bean Forever. He is a crime boss working for the mafia, usually selling drugs and weapons. He also owns a bunch of warehouses. The Shadow Agency has sent out Killer Bean to take him out for unknown reasons, though Killer Bean is out for Cappuccino's weapon department handler, Vagan. This is an extension of the paragraph but on a new line. In The Killer Bean, he is seen as a blue jelly bean with a cyan mouth and blue shoes to go along with him. He is also wields a pistol. In Killer Bean Forever he is a brown coffee bean wearing a tan tuxedo along with a tan hat to match. He wears a yellow tie and a black shirt inside the suit. He is usually seen with a baseball bat. This is an extension of the paragraph but on a new line. Cappuccino is seen as intelligent and stern. He is often berating his beans for being wrong or giving him answers that make no sense or are irrelevant. He even goes as far as to hit them out of a skyscraper with his baseball bat in Killer Bean Forever. He does have a vengeful side as well. Killer Bean killed his nephew so he assigns Vagan to eliminate him as an act of revenge and to find who sent him. In The Killer Bean he has a cocky and cowardly side. He acts scared when Killer Bean threatens him due to Cappuccino smacking him. He decides to try to run when threatened again, but is shot in a comedic way. In Killer Bean Forever, he tries to ask Killer Bean why he wont kill him, but when he is threatened he makes up excuses to leave.  <figure><img src="/imgs/Cappuccino.jpg" alt=""It has become quite apparent to me, that some of you do not value your job." - Cappuccino to his beans."><figcaption>"It has become quite apparent to me, that some of you do not value your job." - Cappuccino to his beans.</figcaption></figure><pre><code>def epic(x,y):
